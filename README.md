# Oxide

Oxide is a language designed for devices with memory and storage restrictions.

> [!NOTE]
> Oxide is still very early in development! Feel free to star this repo to see updates, though. I'll work on it when I have time. College is hard ðŸ˜…

## Goals
Oxide aims to be both fast to execute and easy to store. The compiler will output very small binaries that will execute very efficiently.

## That's cool! Is it a safety-first language?
Are drag cars safety-first cars? No, they're speed-first cars. Therefore: if you need a safety net to write code, you should probably use a different language like Rust. That's not to say that there isn't some safety stuff, but if you need trillions of error types and a compiler that screams at you at the slightest issue, this isn't the language for you.

## Why Tthe name Oxide?
I chose Oxide as the name because N2O (nitrous oxide) is rocket fuel. Simple as that. What, do you think it's weird to name a language after rocket fuel?

Something important: this is a toy language. I'm one person, and I can't feasibly maintain an entire language. This might be a language that people actually use one day, but it's more of an experiment for me right now rather than a production project.
